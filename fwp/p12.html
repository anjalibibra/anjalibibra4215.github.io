    <h2>What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?</h2>
     HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a 
     file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display 
     a web page's words and images.<br> <br>

Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is 
referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come 
in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.

    <li>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web.</li>
        <li>HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.</li>
        <li>Early versions of HTML were static (Web 1.0), while newer iterations feature a great deal of dynamic flexibility. </li>
        <li>Markup is the text that appears between two pointed brackets (e.g., ), and content is everything else.</li>

<h2> understanding html</h2>
HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The 
language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy
 to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to 
 create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under 
 the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and maintains the
  language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.

HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text
 called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, 
 so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup 
 is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. 
 For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw 
 specific attention to a word or phrase.
 <h2>HyperText Markup Language Basics</h2>
At its core, HTML is a series of short codes typed into a text-file. These are the tags that 
power HTML’s capabilities. The text is saved as an HTML file and viewed through a web 
browser. The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, as directed 
by the codes the author used to write what becomes the visible rendering. Writing HTML
 requires tags to be used correctly to create the author’s vision.

The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. Tags are the words between what are 
known as angle-brackets, which allow graphics, images, and tables to appear on the webpage.
 Different tags perform different functions. The most basic tags apply formatting to text.
  As web interfaces need to become more dynamic, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript
   applications may be used. CSS makes web pages more accessible and JavaScript adds power to
    basic HTML.
