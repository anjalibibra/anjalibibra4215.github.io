    <li> <a href ="p1.html" target="base"> basic structure of html</a></li>
          <ul> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup 
            Language <br>
             HTML is the standard markup language for 
            creating Web pages<br> 
             HTML describes the structure of a Web 
            page <br>
             HTML consists of a series of elements 
             HTML elements tell the browser how to 
            display the content <br>
             HTML elements label pieces of content such 
            as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", 
            "this is a link", etc. <br></ul>    
    
    <li> <a href ="p2.html" target="base"> heading tag of html</a>
    <ul>
        HTML headings are defined with 
        the h1 to h6 tags. 
        h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading: 
 </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p7.html" target="base"> use of different formatting tags in html</a>
        HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML 
        provides 
        us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. 
         These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined.
        There are almost 14 options available that how text appears in HTML and XHTML.
    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p3.html" target="base"> use of iamge in html</a>
    <ul> 
        The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a 
web page. 
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; 
images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag 
creates a holding space for the referenced image. 
The "img" tag is empty, it contains attributes only, 
and does not have a closing tag. 
The "img" tag has two required attributes: 
 src - Specifies the path to the image 
 alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
The src Attribute 
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to 
the image. 
<li><b>NOTE</b>: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at 
    that moment, that gets the image from a web server 
    and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that 
    the image actually stays in the same spot in relation 
    to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a 
    broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text 
    are shown if the browser cannot find the image. </li> 
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p4.html" target="base"> use of iamge as link in html</a>
    <ul>
        To use an image as a link, just put the "img" tag 
        inside the "a"tag:
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p5.html" target="base"> use of floating iamge as link in html</a>
    <UL>
        Use the CSS float property to let the image float to 
        the right or to the left of a text
    </UL>
    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p8.html" target="base"> ordered and unordered list in html</a>
    <ul>HTML lists are used to present list of information in well formed and semantic way. There are three different types of list in HTML and each one has a specific purpose and meaning.

    Unordered list — Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.
    Ordered list — Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.</ul></li>
    <li> <a href ="p9.html" target="base"> tables in html</a> 
    <ul>
        A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows 
and columns. <br>
HTML table tag is used to display data in tabular form (row * column). There can be many 
columns in a row.
We can create a table to display data in tabular form, using "table" element, with the 
help of "tr" , "td", and "th" elements.
In Each table, table row is defined by "tr" tag, table header is defined by "th", and table 
data is defined by "td"tags.
HTML tables are used to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, 
navigation bar, body content, footer section etc. But it is recommended to use div tag 
over table to manage the layout of the page .

    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p10.html" target="base"> calender </a> 
    <ul>
        First we will be using the table tag, which will be used to create the structure of the
         calendar. This will give us an idea of how the calendar is created using HTML. 
        Later we will apply some CSS property to make the design of the calendar better.
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <a href ="p6.html" target="base"> defination list in  html</a>
    <ul>
        HTML Description List or Definition List displays elements in definition form like 
        in dictionary. The "dl", "dt" and "dd" tags are used to define description list.
    </ul>
